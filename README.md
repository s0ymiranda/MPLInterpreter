# Interpreter for the Mathematical Programming Language

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing an interpreter for the "Mathematical Programming Language," which was created in a previous course titled “Programming Languages.” The primary objective is to enhance the usability of the language, allowing users to interact with it in a more intuitive and efficient manner.

The Mathematical Programming Language was designed to solve fundamental mathematics problems through numerical methods, providing simplified access to various mathematical algorithms. This language allows tasks such as calculating the determinant of a matrix or solving integrals using the Simpson's method, among other functionalities.

For more information about the development and specifications of the Mathematical Programming Language, you can refer to the [project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/gerardorosetti/programming_languages_project).

## Features of the Interpreter

- **Lexical Analyzer:** Currently, the interpreter includes a lexical analyzer implemented using Flex and C. This component is essential for breaking down the source code into tokens.

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The purpose of the interpreter is to facilitate the execution of instructions in the Mathematical Programming Language, making it accessible even for those with basic programming knowledge.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Flex installed on your system.
   - Have a C compiler (such as GCC) available.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
3. **Acces the scannerFlex folder**
4.  **Compile the Proyect**
    - There is a makefile
5. **Run the scanner**
    ./scanner <souce_code_file>
    in the samples folder, will be found 24 archives as examples
